# Precipitation and Piezometry in SARAI

The notebook takes data given by CSV input file (**sampling locations**) and

1. downloads precipitation and piezometric historical measurements from two internet sources,
2. associates previous measurements with sampling locations given by the input file and, finally,
3. generates output CSV files with measurements or interpolated measurements associated with the closest input sampling locations.

## Installation
It's pretty simple:

1. Install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) on your computer and 
2. import environment file *environment_sarai.yml*. It generates a new environment that allows the notebook to run without problems.

## Configuration file

It's named **config.ini** and is used by the notebook as an input parameters file. It's self-explaining (some comments describe each parameter).

## Data sources

1. Input CSV file with **sampling locations**. It's given by *locations_file* parameter in *config.ini* file. It contains, among others, a geographic location defined by coordinates and a unique field (*location_id_field* parameter in *config.ini* file). The notebook used it as location identification in output measurements CSV files (as column name).

This file must have the character ';' as the field delimiter. Sampling location coordinates are given by geographic coordinates longitude (field *location_lon*) and latitude (field *location_lat*) in *geographic* (*EPSG:4326*) reference system of coordinates.

2. **Precipitation measurements**. Coded as an input parameter *precipitations_url* in the *config.ini* configuration file. It points by default to a packed, compressed file (*\*.tar.gz*) located in [https://www.aemet.es/documentos/es/serviciosclimaticos/cambio_climat/datos_diarios/dato_observacional/rejilla_5km/v2/Serie_AEMET_v2_pcp_1951a2020_txt.tar.gz](https://www.aemet.es/documentos/es/serviciosclimaticos/cambio_climat/datos_diarios/dato_observacional/rejilla_5km/v2/Serie_AEMET_v2_pcp_1951a2020_txt.tar.gz). It contains three files:
   - *README*, which informs about the content of files,
   - *Master*, with precipitation grid coordinates and their IDs,
   - *historical precipitation file*, which contains interpolated precipitation measurements in a grid with a spatial resolution of 5x5 km, and temporal resolution of one day from 1951-01-01 to 2020-21-31. 
  
3. **Piezometric measurements**. Coded again as input parameter *piezometry_url* in the *config.ini* configuration file. It points by default to a compressed file (*\*.zip*) available thought URL [https://www.miteco.gob.es/es/cartografia-y-sig/ide/descargas/basedatospiezometria_tcm30-533415.zip](https://www.miteco.gob.es/es/cartografia-y-sig/ide/descargas/basedatospiezometria_tcm30-533415.zip). This package is composed by two files:
   - The first one contains information about piezometers and geographical locations (with *geometry* as coordinate reference system)
   - The second one includes historical piezometrical measurements.

## Association criteria between input sampling locations and precipitations/piezometric files

Only sources inside a 5 km buffer are taken into account.

### Precipitation
Two criteria applied:
1. Precipitation of the closest point to the sampling location.
2. Interpolated precipitation by inverse distance weighting average method for sources closer or equal to 5 km.

### Piezometry
Only one criterium
1. The most extended temporal piezometric series (for sources with measurements closest or equal to 5 km) is associated with each sampling location.

## Output files

Located in **output_dir** (*./results*) directory given by *config.ini* configuration file.

- **out_interp_precip** (*historico_precipitaciones_ponderado_distancia.csv*), with historical interpolated precipitation measurements, weighted by inverse of distance.

- **out_closest_prepic** (*historico_precipitaciones_punto_mas_cercano.csv*), with historical interpolated precipitation equals to the closest point with measurements.

- **out_longer_piezo** (*historico_piezometrias.csv*), with measurements of longest temporal serie of piezometry taken inside a buffer of, by default, **radius** (*5.000 m*).

- JPG files: all figures generated and showed in the notebook.

CSV output files have following structure: 

*date,ID1, ID2, ID3,...,IDN*

where IDs are the unqie values that identify precipitation grid nodes or piezometers.

## Example

We will show you some screen captures for illustrating the notebook algorithm.

### 1. Loading locations of interest

First, the input data file is a CSV text format file with the character  ';' as the field separator and '.' as the thousand marker.

```python
locations_file = config.get('paths', 'locations_file') # reading input CSV file path from 'config.ini' file
df_loc = pd.read_csv(locations_file, sep=';', decimal=',') 
id_loc = config.get('fields', 'location_id_field') # reading field ID from 'config.ini' file
df_loc = df_loc.set_index(id_loc, drop=False)
print(df_loc.info()) # showing input dataframe info
```

After that, plot sampling locations.

![Sampling locations](/sample_images/localizaciones_de_muestreo.jpg)

### 2. Downloading and processing precipitation data

The next step is to load precipitation data, filtering to the exciting area and plotting both on a map.

![Sampling locations and precipitations grid](/sample_images/nodos_precipitacion_En_area_de_muestreo.jpg)

As mentioned before, there are two association algorithms. The following figure shows the closest sources implementation for a precipitation node of the grid (given by ID = 1868).

And the next one shows precipitation nodes associated with sampling locations.

![Sampling locations and selected node of the precipitations grid](/sample_images/nodos_de_precipitacion_seleccionados.jpg)

and the histogram of distances between associated locations

![distance between sampling and precipitation node locations histogram ](/sample_images/histograma_distancias_nodos_precipitacion-puntos_muestreo.jpg)

Of course, the notebook generates two CSV files with 

- precipitation related to the closest node-sampling location, and
- precipitation computed used the inverse of distance node-sampling location for grid nodes inside a buffer of predefined distance.

### 3. Downloading and processing piezometric data

The process applied to piezometric measures is the same.

![Sampling locations and piezometers grid](/sample_images/piezometros_en_zona_de_muestreo.jpg)

In this case, the association is given between piezometric and sampling locations whose 
- temporal length series is the longest one and
- distance is lower than the number of meters given by the *radius* parameter in the input *config.ini* file.

The following image shows piezometers associated with sampling locations.

![Sampling locations and selected node of the piezometer locations](/sample_images/piezometros_seleccionados.jpg)

And this one the histogram of distances between these associations.

![distance between sampling and piezometer locations histogram ](/sample_images/histograma_distancias_a_piezometros.jpg)

Here is the the histogram that shows number of sampling locations associated to each piezometer.

![association between sampling and piezometer locations histogram ](/sample_images/localizaciones_asociadas_a_piezometros.jpg)

And finally, the following figure shows sampling locations associated with the most popular piezometer (IDPIEZ=2015).

![Sampling locations associated to a given piezometer](/sample_images/localizaciones_asociadas_piezometro_2015.jpg)

Again, the notebook generates a CSV file with associated piezometric measurements to sampling locations as output.
